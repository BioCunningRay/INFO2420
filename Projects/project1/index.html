<h1>Web Site Critiques</h1>
<h2>Jared Farr - INFO2420 - Summer 2025</h2>

<h2>Website - http://pitchfork.com/</h2>
<ol>
    <li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>
    <p>My first impression was that was a news site since I saw a trump article load first. This is more of a music release site. <br> I also wouldn't normally hit this site lol.</p>
    <li>How does this site organize the flow of information? <br>(Do they have linkson the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
    <p>I don't like the flow. Without my ad block I could see this site not working as all. This site doesn't have an intro page or describe what this site is for. I don't like it much. </p>
    <li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
    <P>It makes sense, as all of the tabs have a rhyme or reason. <br> The site is really streamlined and easy to navigate</P>
    <li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract fromit? Why?</li>
    <p>The only graphics I have seen are ads so I think it detracts. It is mostly black and white and its unflattering. </p>
    <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load timereasonable?</li>
    <p>Took about 10 seconds for me. That is reasonable but it does load things in slowly.</p>
    <li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color orimage was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
    <P>Background and text color are legable and is slick.</P>
    <li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was thenavigation well done?</li>
    <p>Navigation needed more hover effects, but it worked properly. I wish there was more explanations of what the tabs are. This site is terrible and I would never visit here again</p>
    <li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?</li>
    <p>It was repeated accross all of the pages, but its just black and white. This site is boring to look at</p>
    <li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>
    <P>It responds fairly well and is really fast when doing the resizing. It doesn't lock to scale to the users page. I don't like this website I have said it once and I will say it again. </P>
    <li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>
    <p>It does have great pictures of the musical artists and is better when I go to the releases page. After navigating throught it I like it much better now. </p>
